# Task-Manager-REST-API

This is a REST API based project. No frontend is added yet. 
Technology used: 
#Java 11
#Spring Boot
#Spring Security
#MySql 
#Maven
So, after cloning need to maven build and then run. 
For testing REST API I hvae used Postman API testing tool. 
For getting API response need to create user at first. I have added a script for adding users. Location: resources/scripts/user.sql
Till now, following API's are availale. I shall add remaining API's within a short time.
"/user/save",
"/project/save",
"/project/getAll",
"/delete/{projectId}"
